I was looking for a good tools to design architecture diagrams, products, UI/UX, things like that...

Two of the tools that catch my attention the most are [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and [whimscal](https://whimsical.com/), the first I more use if I need something quick, doing a pair programming session and need to dive deep into the problem, or brainstorming, for example. The latter is for more for project design and long-term ideas.
